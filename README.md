# Azure Auth Schematic

This repository is a Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point for an authorized angular application using [MSAL.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-lts/lib/msal-angular) to authenticate to an Azure resource. This will get you quickly started on creating a cloud ready angular application.

## Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```
